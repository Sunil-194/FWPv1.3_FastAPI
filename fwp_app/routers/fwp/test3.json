You firmly believe in working hard to achieve your goals and follow a very systematic and disciplined approach while solving problems across different facets of your life. You dislike uncertainty because it leaves you feeling anxious, and you’re apprehensive about deviating from tried-and-tested conventions as you believe it exposes you to unwanted risks.\n\n You’re extremely skilled at negotiating difficult situations by applying a watertight system of checks and balances that you’ve established over time. You’re careful and highly observant, which allows you to anticipate undesirable outcomes and prepare in advance. You believe in taking one step at a time, and that holds you in good stead.",
